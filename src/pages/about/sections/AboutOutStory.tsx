                        <b>La Medusa</b> was born from the idea of creating a
                        place where gastronomy and the sea come together in one
                        atmosphere. We have always believed that a restaurant is
                        not only about food, but also a space that conveys
                        emotions and gives a sense of the specialness of the
                        moment.

                    <p className="description section-description mb-3">
                        From the very beginning, we chose the path of
                        sophistication: fresh ingredients, thoughtful recipes,
                        and service that begins before you even arrive. The
                        panoramic ocean view was our inspiration - every evening
                        here turns into a story that you want to repeat.
